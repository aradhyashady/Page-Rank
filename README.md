# Page Rank
# An AI programme to rank web pages by importance.

# Experimentation Process
Imagine a system where each page is given a rank according to the number of incoming links it has from other pages, and higher ranks would signal higher importance. But this definition isn’t perfect: if someone wants to make their page seem more important, then under this system, they could simply create many other pages that link to their desired page to artificially inflate its rank.

For that reason, the PageRank algorithm was created by Google’s co-founders (including Larry Page, for whom the algorithm was named). In PageRank’s algorithm, a website is more important if it is linked to by other important websites, and links from less important websites have their links weighted less.
